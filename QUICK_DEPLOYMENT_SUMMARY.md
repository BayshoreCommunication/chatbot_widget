# ⚡ QUICK DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY

## 🎯 PROBLEM

```

## 📦 FILES TO DEPLOY (Ready Now!)

### **Upload These 2 Files:**

File 2: chatbot_widget/public/chatbot-widget.js      (24.3 KB)

Build Date: November 2, 2025, 9:36 AM

```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT COMMAND

```bash
# Method 1: Manual Upload
# Use FTP/SFTP to upload the 2 files above to your widget server

# Method 2: Vercel (if applicable)
cd chatbot_widget
vercel --prod
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Clear Cache After Upload!

1. **Server Cache**: Restart web server or purge CDN cache
2. **Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
3. **Test in incognito mode** to verify

## ✅ VERIFICATION (Takes 30 seconds)

1. Go to: https://www.carterinjurylaw.com/
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ "🔐 API Base URL: https://api.bayshorecommunication.org"
   ✅ "🔍 Fetching welcome message from: https://..."
   ```
4. Should NOT see:
   ```
   ❌ "Mixed Content: ...requested an insecure resource 'http://..."
   ```

## 📋 SUCCESS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Uploaded `chatbot-widget.min.js` to production
- [ ] Cleared server/CDN cache
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Console shows HTTPS URLs (🔐)
- [ ] No Mixed Content errors

## 🆘 IF STILL BROKEN

**Most likely cause**: Old files still cached

**Quick fix**:

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Test in incognito mode
3. Check file size on server matches: **16,315 bytes** (chatbot-widget.min.js)
4. If size doesn't match, upload failed - try again
